# 100 Days of SwiftUI

Welcome to my repository for the "100 Days of SwiftUI" challenge! This project is all about learning SwiftUI by following the curriculum provided by [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/). Each day, I will be adding new projects, code snippets, and personal reflections as I progress through the course.

## About the Challenge

The "100 Days of SwiftUI" challenge is a comprehensive guide to mastering SwiftUI, designed by Paul Hudson. It covers everything from the basics of Swift to advanced SwiftUI features, with each day providing new lessons and coding exercises. The course is updated for iOS 17, requiring Xcode 15.3 or later.
